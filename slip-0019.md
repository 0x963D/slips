## Abstract

This specification defines the format for a Proof of Ownership which can be passed to a hardware wallet together with an unsigned transaction. This proof allows the hardware wallet to determine whether the input is controlled by the key owned by the hardware wallet or not. It also allows external parties to verify that the user has the ability to spend the input.

## Motivation

In certain applications like CoinJoin and Lightning the hardware wallet has to deal with transactions containing external inputs. To calculate the actual amount the user is spending the hardware wallet needs to reliably determine whether the input belongs to the user or not. Without such a mechanism an adversary can fool the hardware wallet into displaying incorrect information about the amount being spent, which can result in theft of user funds.

For example, in a CoinJoin transaction the attacker can construct a transaction with two inputs (`in1`, `in2`) of identical value and two outputs of identical value - one belonging to the user (`user_out`) and another belonging to the attacker (`attacker_out`). If such a transaction is sent to the hardware wallet twice with `in1` marked as external the first time and `in2` marked as external the second time, then the hardware wallet will display two signing requests to the user with spending amounts of `in2 - user_out` and `in1 - user_out` respectively. The user will think that they are signing two different CoinJoin transactions and spending `in1 + in2 - 2*user_out` for the fees, while in reality they are signing a single transaction and sending half of the amount to the attacker.

To mitigate such an attack the hardware wallet needs to verify that external inputs do not belong to the wallet. Even though CoinJoin transactions currently work only with P2WPKH addresses other applications may require more complicated inputs including multisignature and Schnorr multisignature in the future.

A CoinJoin server can also benefit from such a proof to verify that the CoinJoin participant is able and willing to sign the input. This verification helps to mitigate denial of service attacks as the attacker has to use a limited UTXO set that he controls and in case of misbehaviour this UTXO set gets banned.

## Ownership proof format

An ownership proof consists of two parts, a `proof_body` and a proof `script_sig`. All signatures in `script_sig` should be verified against the `UTI || proof_body` as a message, where `UTI` is a Unique Transaction Identifier. The `script_sig` should be verified as in a normal Bitcoin transaction - evaluation of the `script_pubkey` (or `witness_script` or `redeem_script`) of the previous output combined with `script_sig` should succeed. In the most common P2(W)PKH case the `script_sig` will contain `{pubkey} || {signature}` and should be evaluated with standard `P2PKH` script.

To verify that the prover is able and willing to sign the input, the particular content of the `proof_body` is not important. The `proof_body` is used by the hardware wallet to determine whether it is able or unable to sign the input.

The proof body is a concatenation of ownership identifiers:

```
P_1 || P_2 || ... || P_n
```

where `n` is the number of cosigners in case of a multisignature input. In `P2(W)PKH` the proof body is a single 32 byte value `P`. An ownership identifier can be an arbitrary 32 byte value, which the corresponding cosigner is able to derive and check. It is recommended to compute the ownership identifier as `P = HMAC-SHA256(k, (txid || vout))`, where `k` is the private key of the HD node `m/19'` according to BIP32, `txid` is the 32 byte hash of the input transaction and `vout` is the 4 byte index that is being spent.

### Unique Transaction Identifier

The purpose of the Unique Transaction Identifier (UTI) is to prevent an attacker from moving an input into a different transaction. This protects against replay attacks which could be used to cause denial of service.

The UTI is not to be confused with TXID, which is the hash of a transaction's data. Since the UTI needs to be known during transaction creation, it cannot be derived from the transaction data but needs to be generated as a nonce. In case of CoinJoin the UTI should be a unique CoinJoin round identifier which can be generated as either:
1. The concatenation of a globally unique CoinJoin server ID (192 bits) with a sequential round number (64 bits).
2. A random 256 bit value.

### Proof construction

The coordinator (i.e. a watch-only software wallet) prepares the `proof_body` and sends it to each signer together with other metadata - derivation path for the input, `script_pubkey`, etc. Every signer that is willing to sign the input for the given UTI uses the `txid` and `vout` of the given input to derive their ownership identifier, checks that it is included in the proof body and if it is, they sign the `UTI || proof_body`.

The coordinator collects all the signatures for the proof, combines them in a `script_sig` and finalizes the proof. This proof can then be verified by external parties to check that the provers are able and willing to sign the input.

When the transaction is ready for signing the coordinator sends the transaction together with the proof for every input and other metadata such as the derivation path to the signers. Each signer then takes the following steps:
1. For each proof verify that the signature is valid, otherwise abort.
2. For each input derive the ownership identifier and if the identifier is included in the proof body, then tag the input for signing.
3. For each tagged input confirm ability to sign the input, otherwise abort.
4. Display the spending amount and ask the user to confirm or decline.
5. Upon user confirmation sign all tagged inputs.

In order to prepare the proof body the coordinator needs to gather the ownership identifiers from the signers. This can be done in advance whenever a new UTXO is created or it can be deferred to later, when the UTXO is to be spent. The proof body SHOULD contain only the ownership identifiers of those signers who will be signing the transaction.

### TODO: Implementation in PSBT

### Script evaluation on hardware wallets

Currently most hardware wallets don't support complete Bitcoin script verification, so initial deployment of the proof can be limited to a set of known scripts. In the future hardware wallets may implement miniscript (TODO: add link) verification, that will cover most of the use-cases known today.
