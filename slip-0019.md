## Abstract

SLIP-0019 defines a Proof of Ownership passed to the hardware wallet together with the unsigned transaction. This proof allows the hardware wallet to verify if the input is controlled by the key owned by the hardware wallet or not. It also allows external parties to verify that the user has the ability to sign the input.

## Motivation

In certain applications like CoinJoin and Lightning the hardware wallet has to deal with transactions containing external inputs. To calculate the actual amount the user is spending hardware wallet needs to reliably determine whether the input belongs to the user or not. Without such mechanism advisory can fool the hardware wallet to display incorrect information about spending amount. 

For example in CoinJoin transaction the attacker can construct a transaction with two identical inputs (`in1`, `in2`) and two identical outputs - one belonging to the user (`user_out`) and another belonging to the attacker (`attacker_out`). If such transaction is sent to the hardware wallet twice with `in1` or `in2` marked as external, the hardware wallet will display two signing requests to the user with spending amounts of `in1-user_out` and `in2-user_out` correspondingly. The user will think that he is signing two different CoinJoin transactions and spending `in1+in2-2*user_out` for the fees, and in reality sign a single transaction and sending half of the amount to the attacker.

To mitigate such an attack the hardware wallet needs to verify that external inputs do not belong to the wallet. Even though CoinJoin transactions currently work only with P2WPKH addresses other application may require more complicated inputs including multisignature and Schnorr multisignature in the future.

A CoinJoin server can also benefit from such a proof to verify that the CoinJoin participant is able to sign the input. This verification helps to mitigate denial of service attack as the attacker has to use a limited UTXO set that he controls and in case of misbehaviour this UTXO set get banned.

## Body

The proof consists of two parts - `proof_body` and proof `script_sig`. All signatures in `script_sig` should be verified against the `proof_body` as a message. `script_sig` should be verified as in normal Bitcoin transaction - evaluation of the `script_pubkey` (or `witness_script` or `redeem_script`) of the previous output combined with `script_sig` should succeed.

In the most common P2(W)PKH case the `script_sig` will contain `{pubkey}|{signature}` and should be evaluated with standard `P2PKH` script.

For external verifier the particular format of the `proof_body` is not important.

The proof body is a tuple:

```
{n*G}|{n*P1}|{n*P2}|...|{n*Pn}
```

where `n` is a random nonce, `n*G` is a corresponding point on the curve, `n*Pi` is a product of the nonce with the identity key of the signer. The identity key can be arbitrary as soon as the signer is able to derive it and check against it. It can be the public key of the `xpub` used in the multisig setup, the public key of the root `xpub` or a public key with a fixed derivation path. In `P2(W)PKH` the proof body is just `{n*G}|{n*P}`.

### Proof construction

Coordinator (i.e. a watch-only software wallet) prepares the `proof_body` and sends it to the signers together with other metadata - derivation pathes for inputs and outputs, `script_pubkey`, etc. Signers check if their identity keys are included in the proof and if so, sign the `proof_body`.

Coordinator collects all the signatures for the proof, combines them in a `script_sig` and finalizes the proof. This proof then can be verified by external parties to check that the input can be signed.

When the transaction is ready for signing the coordinator sends the transaction together with the proof for every input to the signers. Signers verify the proof and all other available metadata necessary to correctly display spending amount for the confirmation.

### TODO: Implementation in PSBT

### Script evaluation on hardware wallets

Currently most hardware wallets don't support complete Bitcoin script verification, so initial deployment of the proof can be limited to a set of known scripts. In the future hardware wallets may implement miniscript (TODO: add link) verification, that will cover most of the use-cases known today.

### Schnorr multisig

As the proof body elements are points on the curve it is possible to use Schnorr signatures and key aggregation to generate a single-key proof for multisignature scheme.

## TODO: Test vectors
